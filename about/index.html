  <p>
  Meixuan (or Max for short) is your average old school software engineer: when
  he's working, he's either typing stuff in vim, running scripts in tmux, or
  looking up things on Google. He's pragmatic, a believer in incremental
  development and fast iterations. He's a follower of "clean code", who
  believes code should be as self explanatory as the language expressiveness
  allows, and minimize redundant comments to avoid more than one source of
  truth. He respects reasons, demands clear rationale behind architectural
  choices, and dismiss over-design and premature optimization.

  When he's not with the machines, he's much more relaxed and much less
  opinionated. He enjoys conversations with friends, or getting closer to
  nature. He recently picked up mountain biking, and is slowly getting better
  at it (eh, he's not in his twenties anymore).  He used to play competitive
  video games like Starcraft and DotA, but now he finds story-driven RPGs more
  fun - although he really needs to git gud at some of them.
