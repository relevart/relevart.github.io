<ul class="about">
  <p>
  Max, a seasoned software engineer, embodies the old-school approach. His
  coding world revolves around the familiar rhythm of vim keystrokes, whirring
  scripts in tmux terminals, and the occasional Google pit stop. A pragmatist
  at heart, he champions incremental development and thrives on rapid
  iterations. Clean code is his gospel. He believes in code that speaks for
  itself, leveraging the language's expressiveness to minimize redundant
  comments â€“ one source of truth is all it takes. Backed by a strong foundation
  in reasoning, he demands clear justifications for architectural decisions,
  with no tolerance for over-engineering or premature optimization.

  Beyond the digital realm, Max sheds his programmer persona. Relaxed and
  easygoing, he engages in stimulating conversations with friends and embraces
  the outdoors. Mountain biking, a recent pastime, is a work in progress (age
  and all that). Competitive gaming, once his domain (think Starcraft and
  DotA), has given way to the allure of story-driven RPGs, though mastering
  them might require some extra practice.
