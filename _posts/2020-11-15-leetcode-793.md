title: "Leetcode: 793. Preimage Size of Factorial Zeroes Function"
date: 2020-11-15
tags: [leetcode]
---

Let f(x) be the number of zeroes at the end of x!. (Recall that x! = 1 * 2 * 3 * ... * x, and by convention, 0! = 1.)

For example, f(3) = 0 because 3! = 6 has no zeroes at the end, while f(11) = 2 because 11! = 39916800 has 2 zeroes at the end. Given K, find how many non-negative integers x have the property that f(x) = K.

Example 1:
Input: K = 0
Output: 5
Explanation: 0!, 1!, 2!, 3!, and 4! end with K = 0 zeroes.

Example 2:
Input: K = 5
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no x such that x! ends in K = 5 zeroes.
Note:

K will be an integer in the range [0, 10^9].

**Solution:**

```
class Solution {
    static int f(int64_t n) {
        int k = 0;
        while (n) {
            n /= 5;
            k += n;
        }
        return k;
    }
    
    static int64_t findLowerBound(int k) {
        // k = f(n) = n/5 + n/25 + n/125 .. <= n/4
        //  -> n >= 4k
        int64_t n_lb = 4 * (int64_t)k;
        // k = f(n) = n/5 + n/25 + n/125 .. >= (n - 5)/5
        //  -> n <= 5(k + 1)
        int64_t n_ub = 5 * ((int64_t)k + 1);
        
        if (f(n_lb) == k) return n_lb;
        
        while (n_lb + 1 < n_ub) {
            int64_t n_mid = (n_lb + n_ub) / 2;
            if (f(n_mid) < k) n_lb = n_mid;
            else n_ub = n_mid;
        }
        
        return n_ub;
    }
    
public:
    int preimageSizeFZF(int K) {
        return K == 0 ? 5 : (findLowerBound(K + 1) - findLowerBound(K));
    }
};
